```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd wanderlust-bites
```

2. Install dependencies:

## üìö Cosmic SDK Examples

### Fetching All Posts

```typescript

const response = await cosmic.objects
  .find({ type: 'posts' })
  .props(['id', 'title', 'slug', 'metadata'])
  .depth(1)

const posts = response.objects
```

### Fetching Posts by Category

```typescript
const response = await cosmic.objects
  .find({ 
    type: 'posts',
    'metadata.categories': categoryId 
  })
  .props(['id', 'title', 'slug', 'metadata'])

```typescript
const response = await cosmic.objects
  .findOne({ 
    type: 'posts',
    slug: 'post-slug'
  })
  .depth(1)

const post = response.object

- **Posts** - Blog articles with title, content (markdown), featured images, authors, and categories
- **Authors** - Food journalists and bloggers with names, bios, and profile photos
- **Categories** - Content classification (Street Food, Fine Dining, Local Cuisine)

The integration uses the Cosmic SDK v1.5+ with proper depth parameters to fetch nested relationships efficiently.
